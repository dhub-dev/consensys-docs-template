# Review contributions

To
[review a documentation pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews):

1. Go to the PR page.

2. Select the **Files changed** tab and read through the documentation changes.

3. View the rendered changes in the PR preview link.

4. Evaluate the changes to the best of your ability. To approve the changes,
   make sure that:

   - The changes are technically accurate.

   - The changes improve your understanding of the subject.

   - The changes make sense in the context they're in.

   - You're not left with any confusion or questions about the subject of the
     changes.

   - The changes follow the [writing style guidelines](style-guide.md) and the
     [markdown guidelines](format-markdown.md).

5. In the **Files changed** tab, hover over any line you want to comment on to
   the right of the line number, and select the plus sign (+). You can also drag
   to select multiple lines at once. Add your comment, or select the file symbol
   to make a specific suggestion. Select **Start a review**, and repeat for any
   other comments or suggestions.

6. When you're done commenting, select **Finish your review** in the upper right
   corner, and select:

   - **Comment** if you have comments or suggestions you want the PR author to
     consider.

   - **Approve** if you think the PR is OK to merge.

   - **Request changes** if you require the author to make changes. Selecting
     this option requires you to approve the PR later before the author can
     merge it.

7. Submit your review.
